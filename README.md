Name: Gayatri Korde

Roll Number: DWP-61

1. Project Overview
The objective of this project is to implement web interfaces based on a selected research paper as part of the TA Assignment. The project involves studying the system design and replicating the user interface (UI) screens using modern web technologies to match the original research outputs.

2. Research Paper Details
Title: CLOUD-BASED LMS FOR E-LEARNING

Authors: N. Angelova, G. Kiryakova, L. Yordanova

Publication: Trakia Journal of Sciences, Vol. 13, Suppl. 1, 2015

Domain: E-Learning and Cloud Computing Systems

Summary: This paper evaluates cloud-based Learning Management Systems (LMS) like TalentLMS, Litmos, and Haiku, focusing on their ability to facilitate interactive learning through specialized web interfaces.

3. Implementation Details
I have replicated three primary interfaces shown in the paper's results:

Conference Interface (index.html): Based on TalentLMS (Figure 1), featuring a real-time collaboration layout with a user status table, presentation whiteboard, and chat functionality.

Course Builder (analysis.html): Based on Litmos LMS (Figure 2), featuring a dark-themed creation dashboard with a tool grid for Assessments, Surveys, and Modules.

Attendance System (attendance.html): Based on Haiku LMS (Figure 3), focusing on a setup form for attendance books with specific data fields and highlighted input styles.

4. Technologies Used
HTML5: For semantic structure, tables, and form elements.

CSS3: For custom styling, dark themes, and layout precision.

CSS Grid & Flexbox: For managing complex multi-pane dashboard layouts.

GitHub: For version control and final project submission.

5. Folder Structure
Consistent with the assignment instructions, the repository is organized as follows:

index.html: Conference Interface

analysis.html: Course Builder Interface

attendance.html: Attendance Management Interface

style.css: Unified stylesheet for all pages

Screenshots/: Folder containing original figures from the research paper

README.md: Project documentation.

6. How to Run
Clone the Repository: Download or clone this folder from GitHub.

Open HTML Files: Locate the .html files in the root directory.

Launch in Browser: Right-click on index.html, analysis.html, or attendance.html and select "Open with" your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge).

View Interface: The CSS is linked internally, so the pages will render with full styling immediately.
